## Understanding Brave's Backup Behavior

### Why Bookmarks Might Be Restored
Brave browser has several mechanisms that can restore deleted bookmarks:

1. **Brave Sync**: If enabled, deleted bookmarks may be restored from other synced devices
2. **Local Backups**: Brave creates automatic local backups that may restore changes
3. **Session Restoration**: Browser restart might restore previous bookmark state

### Recommended Testing Approach
1. **Use Testing Mode**: Enable the built-in testing mode for safe experimentation
2. **Disable Brave Sync**: Turn off sync in Brave settings before major edits
3. **Work with Exported Files**: Use exported JSON files for testing instead of live browser data
4. **Create Manual Backups**: Always backup your original bookmarks file

## Future Development Ideas

### Additional Brave Browser Files
The editor could potentially be expanded to manage other Brave browser data:

- **Login Data** (`Login Data`): Saved passwords and login information
- **History** (`History`): Browsing history database
- **Extensions** (`Extensions/` folder): Installed extension data
- **Preferences** (`Preferences`): Browser settings and configurations
- **Sessions** (`Current Session`, `Last Session`): Tab and window states
- **Cookies** (`Cookies`): Website cookies and site data

### Potential Future Features
- **Brave Data Manager**: Comprehensive tool for all Brave browser data
- **History Viewer**: Browse and search through browsing history
- **Extension Manager**: Backup and restore extension configurations
- **Settings Backup**: Export and import browser preferences
- **Sync Status Monitor**: Real-time sync status and conflict resolution

**Security Note**: Future features involving sensitive data like passwords would require additional security measures and user consent.
